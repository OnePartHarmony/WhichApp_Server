## User Stories
As a user I want the ability to...
  - sign in  or register
  - sign out
  - search a show or movie
  - see where that show or movie is streamed 
  
## MVP
- An app that looks and functions on a basic level with seeded data if not an API; with a navigation bar and a search box

## Stretch	Goals
- Allow users to keep a list of their favorite shows for easy reference

- Allow users to opt into notifications of when a given show/movie will stop streaming on its current app

- Denote base price for a subscription to each streaming service that a show or movie is found on as part of the info populated in the search results

- Give users the capability to store info on which streaming services they already subscribe to so that when they search for a show, they will be told whether they already subscribe

## Version 2
- Allow users to also search for sporting events such as boxing matches

## Version 3
- Live Streaming capabilites for sporting events
